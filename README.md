# Gamespace-Capstone-project.
The project is an Android based mobile application. The application is based on a marketplace where users can buy video game keys which are posted by other users and go through the listings. Find the right seller for any game using our comprehensive and intuitive search filters. See the description, trailers, photos of a specific game while getting the inside scoop from our community of gamers. Search and contact different seller with a few clicks. You can also post your own games you would like to sell and set up your own selling price. Plus, there are minigames to play to win extra credits/discounts for your favorite games.
